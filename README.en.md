## Introduction

Fofa Viewer is a user-friendly FOFA client written in JavaFX, attributed to the WgpSec Community and primarily maintained by [**f1ashine**](https://github.com/f1ashine). By leveraging the powerful internet search engine [FoFa](https://en.fofa.info/), it encapsulates many commonly used APIs into a concise UI, making it easier for cybersecurity professionals to hunt for vulnerabilities on target websites. With its out-of-the-box functionality, Fofa Viewer streamlines the search process, helping penetration testers quickly obtain the information they need.

## Usage
The data obtained by this tool through FoFa's API.  
You need to set the API key of senior member or ordinary member to the file config.properties.  
Using the API key of the registered user will prompt that the account needs to be topped up with F coins

## Q&A
1. Why I can't export more than 10000 items?

  Due to FOFA API limitions, only a maximum of 10000 items can be returned in a single query.
  Please try adding `after` and `before` criteria to limit total data count.

2. Why not all data can be displayed and exported?

  We removed some duplicates in returned data. Following types of data are removed:
  - Port 80: remove items with `http` protocol field
    ![](docs/80http.png)
  - Port 443: remove items with `https` protocol field
    ![](docs/443https.png)
  - Non port 80: remove items with `http` protocol field
    ![](docs/Èùû80http.png)
  - Non port 443: remove items with `https` protocol field
    ![](docs/Èùû443https.png)

3. Why some favicons are missing?

  A browser do following steps to get a favicon:
  - Select `<link rel="icon" href=...>` tag in HTML header
  - If no such tags are found, try load `favicon.ico` in site root
  - If no such file, no favicon is provided

  This tool use jsonp to parse HTML document, thus it is unable to parse some js-bundled site. In this case, paste favicon link into homepage's hash box manually.
   
4. How to sort both IP and Port fields?

  Click IP or Port's column heading to select it, then hold shift and select another column to sort together.
